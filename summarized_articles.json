But starving people doesn’t motivate them – despite centuries of this rhetoric</p><p>For more than 200 years, common wisdom and policymakers have assumed that to get people to work, you had to make them hungry. New work requirements for Snap food benefits, which went into effect in most of the US on 1 December, are only the latest in a long line of policies based on this idea. The new rules cut off benefits for any non-disabled adult up to age 65 who cannot prove that they are working or seeking work at least 80 hours every month (that includes homeless people, veterans and former foster youth). The Congressional Budget Office estimates that <a href=\"https://civileats.com/2025/11/03/food-insecurity-predicted-to-rise-as-new-snap-work-requirements-take-effect/\">2.7 million people will lose their benefits</a>.</p><p>You’ve heard this reasoning before: people are motivated to work because they and their families have to survive. If you give someone welfare – especially food aid – they become dependent and lazy. The Florida-based Foundation for Government Accountability, a conservative thinktank that has been campaigning for years to cut welfare, calls this “<a href=\"https://thefga.org/research/universal-work-requirements/\">the dependency trap</a>”. Starving people by taking away their food stamps is supposed to “incentivize individuals to better themselves and transition from dependency to work and self-reliance”.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/12/snap-food-stamp-work-requirement\">Continue reading...</a>",

        "text": "<p>Residents of Gloster, Mississippi, are suing plant that exports wood pellets to UK and Europe. Company says it is reducing emissions</p><p>When Helen Reed first learned about the bioenergy mill opening in her hometown of Gloster, Mississippi, the word was it would bring jobs and economic opportunities. It was only later that she learned that activity came with a cost: the Amite Bioenergy mill, opened in 2014 by British energy giant Drax, emits large – and sometimes illegal – quantities of air pollutants, including methanol, acrolein and formaldehyde, which are linked to cancers and other serious illnesses.</p><p>“When I go out, I can’t hardly catch my breath,” Reed said. “Everything is worse since Drax came here.”</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/17/mississippi-wood-pellet-industry-energy\">Continue reading...</a>",

These plants are perennials – they keep growing, year after year. That single characteristic separates them from soya beans, wheat, maize, rice and every other major grain crop, all of which are annuals: plants that live and die within a single growing season.</p><p>“These plants are the winners, the ones that get to pass their genes on [to future generations],” says Lee DeHaan of <a href=\"https://landinstitute.org/\">the Land Institute</a>, an agricultural non-profit based in Salina, Kansas. If DeHaan’s breeding programme maintains its current progress, the descendant of these young perennial crop plants could one day usher in a wholesale revolution in agriculture.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/12/soil-is-more-important-than-oil-inside-the-perennial-grain-revolution\">Continue reading...</a>",

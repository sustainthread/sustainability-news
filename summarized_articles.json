But only a real bargain between rich and poor nations can weather the climate shocks that are coming</p><p>This year’s UN climate talks in Brazil’s Belém ended without a major breakthrough. The text of the final <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/22/cop30-deal-inches-closer-to-end-of-fossil-fuel-era-after-bitter-standoff\">agreement</a> lacked a deal to shift away from <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/cop30-key-outcomes-agreed-at-the-un-climate-talks-in-belem/\">fossil fuels</a>, delayed crucial finance and the “mutirão” decision contained no roadmap to halt and reverse deforestation. But the multilateral system at Cop30 held together at a point when its collapse felt close. This ought to be a warning: next year’s conference of the parties must strike a better bargain between the rich and poor world.</p><p>Developing countries are far from united on some issues. Over rare earth minerals <a href=\"https://resourcegovernance.org/articles/why-minerals-still-matter-cop30-whats-stake-if-theyre-left-out\">China sees any move as targeting its dominance, while Africa sees it as essential for governance</a>.

Yet the global south broadly coheres around a simple principle: its nations must be equipped to survive a climate emergency they did not create. That means cash to build <a href=\"https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/environment/global-commitments-on-climate-finance-must-be-fulfilled-rizwana\">flood</a> defences, make agricultural systems resilient, protect coastlines and rebuild after disasters strike.

Its outcome, <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Mutir%C3%A3o_cop30.pdf\">the decision text</a> known as the Global Mutirão or Global Collective Effort, is, in essence, a form of climate denial.</p><p>In 2023, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change<strong> </strong>(IPCC) <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/syr/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_SYR_FullVolume.pdf\">determined that the world</a> had already developed, or planned to develop, too much fossil fuel to be able to halt global heating at 2C. It acknowledged that the capital assets built up around fossil fuels must be stranded – that is to say, abandoned and not used – if warming was to be limited to 2C.

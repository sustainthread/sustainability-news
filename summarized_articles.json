That beat analyst expectations of $2.03 billion, according to an LSEG-compiled consensus.\n\nBP's third-quarter net profit came in at $2.3 billion last year and $2.35 billion in the second quarter of 2025.\n\n\"We've delivered another quarter of good performance across the business with operations continuing to run well,\" BP CEO Murray Auchincloss said in a statement.\n\n\"We are looking to accelerate delivery of our plans, including undertaking a thorough review of our portfolio to drive simplification and targeting further improvements in cost performance and efficiency,\" Auchincloss said.\n\nThe oil major's third-quarter net debt came in at $26.05 billion, broadly flat from the previous quarter, although up from $24.27 billion a year earlier.\n\nLondon-listed shares of BP rose 0.5% on Tuesday morning.\n\nSome other third-quarter highlights included:\n\nOperating cash flow came in at $7.8 billion, up from $6.3 billion three months ago.\n\nBP said it expects divestment and other proceeds to be above $4 billion in 2025.\n\nBP also announced another $750 million in share buybacks over the next three months, maintaining the pace of its shareholder returns, albeit at a reduced level from earlier in the year.\n\nThe results come just over eight months after the company launched a fundamental strategic reset.\n\nBP, which has been the subject of intense takeover speculation, is looking to regain investor confidence by slashing renewable spending and prioritizing its traditional oil and gas business.\n\nInvestors appear to have broadly welcomed the oil and gas major's green strategy U-turn, with share prices up more than 13% year-to-date. The improving sentiment has also been attributed to the firm's leadership shake-up, progress on its cost-cutting program and a string of recent oil discoveries.\n\nBP on Monday announced it had agreed to sell minority stakes in some of its U.S. onshore pipeline assets in the Permian and Eagle Ford basins to private investor Sixth Street for $1.5 billion. BP has previously said it is targeting $20 billion in divestments by the end of 2027.\n\nLast week, British rival Shell reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter profit, citing robust operational performance and higher trading contributions.",

        "text": "The Shell gas station logo is displayed on February 13, 2025 in Austin, Texas.\n\nBritish oil major Shell on Thursday reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter profit, citing robust operational performance and higher trading contributions.\n\nShell posted adjusted earnings of $5.4 billion for the quarter, beating analyst expectations of $5.05 billion, according to an LSEG-compiled consensus. A separate, company-provided analyst forecast had put Shell's expected third-quarter profit at $5.09 billion.\n\nThe London-headquartered firm reported adjusted earnings of $6 billion over the same period last year and $4.26 billion for this year's April-June period.\n\n\"Shell delivered another strong set of results, with clear progress across our portfolio and excellent performance in our Marketing business and deepwater assets in the Gulf of America and Brazil,\" Shell CEO Wael Sawan said in a statement.\n\nThe company also announced another $3.5 billion in share buybacks over the next three months, maintaining the pace of its shareholder returns. The company said it marked the 16th consecutive quarter of at least $3 billion in buybacks.\n\nShell's net debt came in at $41.2 billion at the end of the third quarter, down from $43.2 billion on a quarterly basis.\n\nThe oil major's London-listed share price finished Thursday's session up 0.2%. The stock price is up more 16% year-to-date, outperforming its industry peers.\n\n\"Numbers are solid in virtually all divisions and shows earning growth and strong cash flow generation,\" said Maurizio Carulli, global energy and materials analyst at Quilter Cheviot.\n\n\"Of note the robust production in Brazil and the Gulf of Mexico. The LNG Canada ramp up, with an initial 13 cargos in Q3, benefited the results as well. The only weak part was Chemicals, but it is a small part of the business and Shell's management is trying to find a strategic solution for it,\" Carulli said.\n\nOther third-quarter highlights included:\n\nAdjusted earnings fell 9.9% compared to the same period last year.\n\nCash flow from operations (CFFO) came in at $12.2 billion for the third quarter, compared to $14.7 billion in the same period last year.\n\nCash capital expenditure for the quarter stood at $4.9 billion.\n\nShell's results come as French oil major TotalEnergies reported a slight drop in third-quarter profit as oil and gas production growth helped to offset lower crude prices.\n\nNorwegian energy firm Equinor , for its part, on Wednesday posted a steeper-than-expected drop in third-quarter profit, with adjusted operating income coming in at $6.21 billion for the July-September period.\n\nU.S. oil giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron are both scheduled to report third-quarter results on Friday, with Britain's BP set to follow suit on Tuesday.\n\nAnalysts expect Big Oil's shareholder payouts to come under pressure over the coming months, with energy majors looking to tighten their belts amid a weaker crude price environment.",

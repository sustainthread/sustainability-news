New work requirements for Snap food benefits, which went into effect in most of the US on 1 December, are only the latest in a long line of policies based on this idea. The new rules cut off benefits for any non-disabled adult up to age 65 who cannot prove that they are working or seeking work at least 80 hours every month (that includes homeless people, veterans and former foster youth). The Congressional Budget Office estimates that <a href=\"https://civileats.com/2025/11/03/food-insecurity-predicted-to-rise-as-new-snap-work-requirements-take-effect/\">2.7 million people will lose their benefits</a>.</p><p>You’ve heard this reasoning before: people are motivated to work because they and their families have to survive.

    "text": "Every weekday, the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer holds a \"Morning Meeting\" livestream at 10:20 a.m. ET. Here's a recap of Tuesday's key moments. 1. Stocks are higher ahead of Wednesday's Federal Reserve interest rate decision. The U.S. central bank is expected to cut rates by 25 basis points, making it the third cut of 2025 and a catalyst for the market. \"If the Fed cuts, that's just gigantic for some of our stocks,\" Jim Cramer said, mentioning rate-sensitive Club name Home Depot and technology stocks. Meanwhile, our \"own it, don't trade it\" name, Nvidia , is in the headlines again after President Donald Trump confirmed he will allow the company to sell its more advanced H200 chips to approved customers in China, provided the U.S. gets a 25% cut. Wells Fargo estimates it could add $25 billion to $30 billion in annual revenue and $0.60 to $0.70 in earnings per share. We're not banking on China, but it's a bonus if Nvidia gets the sales. 2. Shares of chemical company Linde climbed 1% Tuesday following news that CEO Sanjiv Lamba bought 2,520 shares of Linde at roughly $396 per share, roughly $1 million worth, according to a recent SEC filing. The stock hit a new 52-week low on Monday of $387.78 and has dropped about 18% since the start of October. The last time Lamba bought shares was in March 2022 at $268.62 per share, also $1 million worth at the time. Despite the very disappointing performance over the past few months, this insider buying could be \"a sign that the stock price action might be wrong and the business is actually holding up better than the market thinks,\" said portfolio director Jeff Marks. 3. \"I am concerned now about Costco,\" Jim said, comparing it to Walmart , which has been a stronger-performing retailer this year. Walmart stock is up 26% year to date, while Costco shares are down 3% over the same period. Jim said he regards Costco as \"one of the greatest performing stocks of all time\" and doesn't want to sell it. But he added that if it keeps going down, he will have to reevaluate. We would like to see a signal from management that proves this decline isn't a new normal when Costco reports its first quarter of fiscal 2026 on Thursday after the bell. 4. Stocks covered in Tuesday's rapid fire at the end of the video were: CVS , Toll Brothers , Marvell Tech , Campbell's , and PepsiCo . (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long HD, NVDA, LIN, COST. See here for a full list of the stocks.) — Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that Costco shares are down 3% year to date.

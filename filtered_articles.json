The new rules cut off benefits for any non-disabled adult up to age 65 who cannot prove that they are working or seeking work at least 80 hours every month (that includes homeless people, veterans and former foster youth). The Congressional Budget Office estimates that <a href=\"https://civileats.com/2025/11/03/food-insecurity-predicted-to-rise-as-new-snap-work-requirements-take-effect/\">2.7 million people will lose their benefits</a>.</p><p>You’ve heard this reasoning before: people are motivated to work because they and their families have to survive.

    "text": "<p>There’s much more to do, but we should be encouraged by the progress we have made</p><p>Today marks the 10th anniversary of the Paris climate treaty, one of the landmark days in climate-action history. Attending the conference as a journalist, I watched and listened and wondered whether 194 countries could ever agree on anything at all, and the night before they did, people who I thought were more sophisticated than me assured me they couldn’t. Then they did. There are a lot of ways to tell the story of what it means and where we are now, but any version of it needs respect for the complexities, because there are a lot of latitudes between the poles of total victory and total defeat.</p><p>I had been dreading the treaty anniversary as an occasion to note that we have not done nearly enough, but in July I thought we might be able celebrate it. Because, on 23 July, the international court of justice handed down an epochal ruling that gives that treaty enforceable consequences it never had before. It declares that all nations have a legal obligation to act in response to the climate crisis, and, as Greenpeace International <a href=\"https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/77262/international-court-justice-historic-advisory-opinion-climate-impacts/\">put</a> it, “obligates states to regulate businesses on the harm caused by their emissions regardless of where the harm takes place. Significantly, the court found that the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment is fundamental for all other human rights, and that intergenerational equity should guide the interpretation of all climate obligations.” The Paris treaty was <a href=\"https://www.icj-cij.org/node/205627\">cited</a> repeatedly as groundwork for this decision.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/12/paris-climate-treaty-anniversary\">Continue reading...</a>",

As a result Indian and Chinese refiners have started to cut down imports of Russian oil.\n\nAccording to a Reuters report on Thursday, Russian oil is trading at its steepest discounts to Brent in a year in Asia, as major Indian and Chinese refiners reduce purchases.\n\nIndia's Petroleum and Natural Gas ministry did not immediately respond to CNBC's query on the country cutting Russian oil imports.\n\n\"Over the long term, completely phasing out Russian oil isn't realistic for India,\" said Prateek Pandey head of APAC oil and gas research at Rystad Energy, adding that as Russian crude becomes available at a sharper discount \"New Delhi's approach of \"economics first\" will be tested more than ever.",

That beat analyst expectations of $2.03 billion, according to an LSEG-compiled consensus.\n\nBP's third-quarter net profit came in at $2.3 billion last year and $2.35 billion in the second quarter of 2025.\n\n\"We've delivered another quarter of good performance across the business with operations continuing to run well,\" BP CEO Murray Auchincloss said in a statement.\n\n\"We are looking to accelerate delivery of our plans, including undertaking a thorough review of our portfolio to drive simplification and targeting further improvements in cost performance and efficiency,\" Auchincloss said.\n\nThe oil major's third-quarter net debt came in at $26.05 billion, broadly flat from the previous quarter, although up from $24.27 billion a year earlier.\n\nLondon-listed shares of BP rose 0.5% on Tuesday morning.\n\nSome other third-quarter highlights included:\n\nOperating cash flow came in at $7.8 billion, up from $6.3 billion three months ago.\n\nBP said it expects divestment and other proceeds to be above $4 billion in 2025.\n\nBP also announced another $750 million in share buybacks over the next three months, maintaining the pace of its shareholder returns, albeit at a reduced level from earlier in the year.\n\nThe results come just over eight months after the company launched a fundamental strategic reset.\n\nBP, which has been the subject of intense takeover speculation, is looking to regain investor confidence by slashing renewable spending and prioritizing its traditional oil and gas business.\n\nInvestors appear to have broadly welcomed the oil and gas major's green strategy U-turn, with share prices up more than 13% year-to-date. The improving sentiment has also been attributed to the firm's leadership shake-up, progress on its cost-cutting program and a string of recent oil discoveries.\n\nBP on Monday announced it had agreed to sell minority stakes in some of its U.S. onshore pipeline assets in the Permian and Eagle Ford basins to private investor Sixth Street for $1.5 billion. BP has previously said it is targeting $20 billion in divestments by the end of 2027.\n\nLast week, British rival Shell reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter profit, citing robust operational performance and higher trading contributions.",

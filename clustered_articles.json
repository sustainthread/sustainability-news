We actually assumed that a second wave would be necessary. But now it's probably not — the first wave, if you'd like to call it, the first attack was so successful, we probably don't have to do a second but we're prepared to do a second wave, a much bigger wave.\"\n\nWashington launched a military operation in Venezuela over the weekend that led to the capture of the country's president, Nicolas Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores, both of whom were indicted on drug trafficking charges. The pair pleaded not guilty. Maduro claimed he'd been \"kidnapped\" and was a \"prisoner of war\" at a court appearance in New York this week.\n\nOn Thursday, Jorge Rodríguez, head of Venezuela's National Assembly, announced that the government would release a significant number of foreign and Venezuelan prisoners. Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares later said five Spanish prisoners had been released and were on a flight back to their home country.\n\nSince Maduro's ousting, Trump has turned his attention to oil-rich Venezuela's energy resources, saying shortly after the operation took place that he had been in talks with oil giants about rebuilding the country's oil infrastructure.\n\nIn his post on Friday, Trump said at least $100 billion will be invested in Venezuela by \"Big Oil,\" noting that he would meet with representatives for U.S. oil giants at the White House later on Friday.\n\nChevron is currently the only oil major operating in Venezuela, and U.S. oil majors have so far been largely silent on Trump's push for their participation in rebuilding the country's energy systems.\n\nVenezuela, a founding member of the powerful OPEC energy alliance, sits on 303 billion barrels of crude oil, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That represents around 17% of the world's oil reserves — but it's currently thought to produce less than 1% of global oil output, and exports only half of what it makes.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump said Venezuelan authorities would give the U.S. up to 50 million barrels of oil, which will be sold at market prices.\n\n\"That money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States!\" Trump said at the time. Sources close to the White House later told CNBC that Venezuela will ship sanctioned oil to the U.S. indefinitely.\n\n— CNBC's Sam Meredith contributed to this article.",

Please refresh the page if you do not see a player above at that time.]\n\nEnergy Secretary Chris Wright is scheduled to speak publicly for the first time since the U.S. removed Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro from power.\n\nWright will be interviewed by Goldman Sachs Wednesday at the bank's annual energy conference in Miami. He will likely answer questions about President Donald Trump's call for U.S. oil companies to invest in Venezuela.\n\nWright will also speak with oil executives at the conference about the situation in Venezuela. Executives from Chevron and ConocoPhillips are attending. Chevron is the only U.S. oil major operating in Venezuela.\n\n\"Secretary Wright remains in close contact with U.S. oil companies and plans to meet with several of them at the Goldman Sachs Energy Conference in Miami on Wednesday,\" a Department of Energy spokesperson told CNBC.\n\nVenezuela has the largest proven oil reserves in the world, but it is unclear whether U.S. oil majors are prepared to invest due to instability in the South American nation.",

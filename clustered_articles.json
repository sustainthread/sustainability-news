Or, put another way, when did just leaving it there become the thing <em>not</em> to do? When did we start becoming disgusted at those who didn’t pick it up rather than those who did?

        "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/14/big-tech-google-microsoft-energy-hiring-ai.html",
        "date": "2026-01-14",
        "source": "Energy",
        "text": "In this article VST\n\nBP.-GB\n\nGOOGL\n\nOKLO\n\nMSFT Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nBig Tech has been on an energy hiring spree. Technology companies investing heavily in artificial intelligence are bolstering their workforce with energy experts as they look to overcome the biggest bottleneck in scaling AI: access to power. Energy-related hiring jumped 34% year-on-year in 2024, according to data compiled by Workforce.ai for CNBC. Last year's hiring almost matched this pace and remained 30% higher than pre-AI levels of 2022, when ChatGPT was released late in the year. Energy is increasingly important to Big Tech companies whose AI ambitions hinge on securing power for insatiable data centers. Data centers accounted for around 1.5% of global electricity consumption in 2024 – representing a 12% year-on-year rise over the last five years, per the International Energy Agency. Demand is widely anticipated to increase further in line with the build-out of infrastructure. Meeting that demand is one of Big Tech's biggest hurdles, leading companies to bring energy knowledge in-house and build their own supply — and, in some cases, gobbling up whole companies along the way. It marks a step-change from traditional sustainability roles, which boomed in the Inflation Reduction Act era but lost steam amid broader ESG backlash that intensified as U.S. President Donald Trump's second term got underway. Instead, operational roles have been in demand: energy procurement, markets, grid interface and strategy, according to energy recruiters who spoke with CNBC.\n\nMicrosoft is a quiet winner of the talent war, with over 570 additions since 2022, including Betsy Beck who joined in January last year as director of energy markets. She previously held an energy markets and policy role at Google . Microsoft also snapped up General Electric's former CFO Carolina Dybeck Happe back in 2024 to be the firm's chief operating officer — perhaps an early indication of the mega-cap's playbook. It is second only to Amazon, which has notched 605 energy-related hires, though this data includes its subsidiary AWS. Google has played catch-up to its Silicon Valley neighbors when it comes to AI – and it appears to be paying off as shares in its parent company, Alphabet, have been on a tear. Its market capitalization surpassed Apple's for the first time since 2019 on last week. The technology giant's energy strategy — which has seen the addition of 340 hires since 2022 — has also garnered attention. Eric Schubert, an energy regulatory affairs advisor who previously worked with BP for nearly 14 years, joined Google in January, per his LinkedIn profile. Google brought Duke University researcher Tyler Norris on board in November to head up energy market innovation, and is still growing its energy market and policy team.\n\nTargeting energy and data center know-how\n\nAs well as individual talent grabs, Big Tech has snapped up energy-related companies while simultaneously scaling work with contractors. Notably, Alphabet is set to acquire data center company Intersect in a $4.75 billion cash deal that includes the assumption of debt. Project and construction managers and people with land acquisition roles are increasingly in demand but are being serviced with temporary contracts to oversee the initial build-out of infrastructure for these tech giants, rather than via permanent employees, according to Daniel Smart, group CEO of The Green Recruitment Company.\n\n\"There are tech companies that are turning into energy companies,\" Daniel Smart group CEO of The Green Recruitment Company\n\nSuch companies are comfortable owning, funding, and running energy projects, \"but they've never built one before, it's not really their core business,\" Smart said. \"So they'll outsource the construction of it, and possibly even outsource the running of it and just buy the energy. So there's different models and different ways in which they do it.\" \"Phase two\" will be to try to improve the energy efficiency of data centers — perhaps leading to more permanent roles — he added, but it's not a current priority as \"there's such a scramble for just getting the energy.\" It could spell trouble for utilities and other energy companies now battling Big Tech's deep pockets for acquiring talent.\n\nwatch now\n\nJeff Anderson, business development director of a renewable energy recruitment consultancy Taylor Hopkinsons, said his team is \"talking to senior candidates from the energy infrastructure space who are becoming aware of the opportunities in data centres and the higher salaries on offer in tech, and are making enquiries and plans to move across long-term.\" \"In the short-term, the talent market is going to be tight. The skillsets the tech companies are hiring — energy strategy, PPAs, grid connection — are already in demand across renewables and utilities. The talent is there, but it's a finite pool and that means competition for specialists that have tangible project experience is going to increase,\" he added. For Travis Miller, senior equities energy and utilities analyst at Morningstar, increased energy demand actually offers \"big opportunities\" for utilities and their workforce as tech companies turn to them for support rather than seeing them as acquisition targets. \"That's the most efficient way to do it from a workforce perspective and from an infrastructure perspective,\" Miller told CNBC.",

        "text": "US President Donald Trump speaks during the House Republican Party (GOP) member retreat at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, on January 6, 2026.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said he has canceled a fresh military attack on Venezuela, saying the two countries \"are working well together,\" on rebuilding the nation's oil and gas infrastructure.\n\nWriting on Truth Social on Friday, Trump noted Venezuela's release of \"large numbers of political prisoners\" which he called \"a very important and smart gesture.\"\n\n\"Because of this cooperation, I have cancelled the previously expected second Wave of Attacks, which looks like it will not be needed, however, all ships will stay in place for safety and security purposes,\" Trump said.\n\nIn a press conference on Jan. 3, Trump had suggested it was unlikely a second attack on Venezuela would be deemed necessary due to what he called the success of the first operation.\n\n\"We are ready to stage a second and much larger attack, if we need to do so,\" he told reporters at the time. \"So we were prepared to do a second wave if we needed to do so. We actually assumed that a second wave would be necessary. But now it's probably not — the first wave, if you'd like to call it, the first attack was so successful, we probably don't have to do a second but we're prepared to do a second wave, a much bigger wave.\"\n\nWashington launched a military operation in Venezuela over the weekend that led to the capture of the country's president, Nicolas Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores, both of whom were indicted on drug trafficking charges. The pair pleaded not guilty. Maduro claimed he'd been \"kidnapped\" and was a \"prisoner of war\" at a court appearance in New York this week.\n\nOn Thursday, Jorge Rodríguez, head of Venezuela's National Assembly, announced that the government would release a significant number of foreign and Venezuelan prisoners. Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares later said five Spanish prisoners had been released and were on a flight back to their home country.\n\nSince Maduro's ousting, Trump has turned his attention to oil-rich Venezuela's energy resources, saying shortly after the operation took place that he had been in talks with oil giants about rebuilding the country's oil infrastructure.\n\nIn his post on Friday, Trump said at least $100 billion will be invested in Venezuela by \"Big Oil,\" noting that he would meet with representatives for U.S. oil giants at the White House later on Friday.\n\nChevron is currently the only oil major operating in Venezuela, and U.S. oil majors have so far been largely silent on Trump's push for their participation in rebuilding the country's energy systems.\n\nVenezuela, a founding member of the powerful OPEC energy alliance, sits on 303 billion barrels of crude oil, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That represents around 17% of the world's oil reserves — but it's currently thought to produce less than 1% of global oil output, and exports only half of what it makes.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump said Venezuelan authorities would give the U.S. up to 50 million barrels of oil, which will be sold at market prices.\n\n\"That money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States!\" Trump said at the time. Sources close to the White House later told CNBC that Venezuela will ship sanctioned oil to the U.S. indefinitely.\n\n— CNBC's Sam Meredith contributed to this article.",

Environmental policy rollbacks by Donald Trump’s administration were not significant factors in the increase because they were only put in place this year, the study authors said. Heat-trapping gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas are the major cause of worsening global warming, scientists say.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/13/us-carbon-emissions-increase-2025\">Continue reading...</a>",
